Automatic transmission. It's been VERY reliable car, definitely the most reliable car I've owned. Cruises smooth on the freeway and always felt extremely safe driving since the car is literally a tank.  Gets a rock-solid 30 mpg, no matter how you drive. The engine is all stock, with 242901 on the odometer and will easily go to 500k (and they do!) It's been well maintained and just had service at Strictly Mercedes in Lake City Engine, with a clean bill of health. The GOOD: Very comfy to drive. Clean title in hand, in my name. Transmission is strong and the Engine ALWAYS starts with no issue, battery is good. Brand new windshield, new fuel filter, new front tires, new rear brakes (pads, rotors and calipers), also aligned at Tru-Line frame and wheel. All power windows work as well as the sunroof, heater works. All the lights and signals work, radio works as well. The BAD: To be honest the interior is rough, the seats work great and the leather is in good shape, but a lot of the pillar trim and some wood trim has seen better days. No serious accidents, but the right front fender has some dents from a parking maneuver gone awry. Perfect used fender included with car. It very comfortable to drive and if you can see past the interior, and would just like a reliable, SAFE TANK that gets great mileage, this is definitely the car for you.

It was named after Leopardus pajeros, the Pampas cat, which is native to the Patagonia plateau region of southern Argentina.[3] But pajero in Spanish is also a common term of abuse, usually translated as \"wanker\" or \"tosser\", thus perhaps why alternative names have been used for many markets. It is known as the Mitsubishi Montero (meaning \"mountain hunter\"[4]) in the Americas (except Brazil and Jamaica), and Spain, while in the United Kingdom it is known as the Mitsubishi Shogun.", "\n", "\nThe first Pajero prototype was unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show in November 1973. The Pajero II prototype followed in 1978, five years later. Mitsubishi's aim was to create more of a recreational vehicle, not just an SUV, as an alternative to the Toyota Land Cruiser and the Nissan Patrol for Japanese buyers.", "\n", "\nIn January 1983, the first Pajero made its debut at the Paris Dakar Rally, taking first place in 1985 at only the third attempt. To date, the Pajero is the most successful vehicle in the Dakar Rally (winning its class 7 out of the last 10 races, and 15 of the full 32 races).[5] This not only gave the Pajero an off-road reputation, but also helped in the sales department. Other wins followed, at events such as the Australasian Safari and Northern Forest.\"", "\n", "\nSo... the Pajero is legendary.  They sold them all over the world except... here in the states.  ", "\n", "\nThis particular Pajero has been modified in a few important ways.  Most importantly, it has a removable hardtop convertible with heavy duty custom roll cage.  She also has custom bumpers and rock rails.  It has a one inch body lift and a five speed transmission.  Professional Rhino line around the bumpers and throughout the interior.  She's powered by a 2.4 liter TURBO GAS engine with an SDS electronic fuel injection system.  This is NOT the turbo diesel.  Other goodies include PIAA driving lights, Garmin GPS, Alpine stereo, and 32\" mudder tires.  Dual bouncy seats and upgraded seats with armrests from newer Mitsubishi.  Sheep Skin Seat covers.  Interior panels have been redone in black vinyl and looks great.  I'll take more photos this weekend and post them.", "\n", "\nFOR THOSE WHO HAVE ASKED:", "\n", "\nThe Pajero has about 145k miles on it.  Engine has been rebuilt.   It has a body lift as well as heavy duty shackles.  All modifications are professionally done including roll cage, bumpers, skid plates, top, etc.  It also has a Garmin GPS as well as an Alpine sound system.  Really neat and collectible rig.", "\n", "\nHere are some more photos...", "\n", "\nShe's badged as Pajero and titled as Montero.

This engine's variable camshaft timing widens the powerband such that the engine will make good torque from 2000 RPM all the way to 8000.  You can tractor around town at 25mph in 3rd gear no problem...but 3rd is good all the way to 100.  4th is good from about 35 to 130.  It's crazy.  This car is on rails at 150 mph.

And the engine sound from the driver's seat is pure music...", "\n", "\nNotes on the SMG transmission:  This has the SAME trans & clutch as a manual 6-spd car; the difference is the automated shifting mechanism that works the clutch and shifts the transmission.  There is a shift lever in the normal place, as well as paddles on the steering wheel.  I didn't think I'd like this transmission...but now I really do.  Once you figure out how to drive it, shifts are smooth and quick...and YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL when you're driving fast on a twisty road.  And this car is so powerful and well balanced that you can drive it REALLY fast on a twisty road.  Fast enough that a missed shift or a split second fuckup could send you off in the weeds in the blink of an eye.  Believe me, not having to reach for that shift lever is a huge advantage in the twistys.", "\n", "\nIt may sound like I drive this car hard but I don't, really.  I don't spin the tires, I don't shift at full throttle in 1st & 2nd, and I've never launched it.  I do like to drive it fast, and therein lies my reason for selling.

Audi released a 180 hp 5-speed single exhaust front wheel drive model, but this is the 225 hp 6-speed dual exhaust all wheel drive model. The car runs well with no major issues. For the time that I've had it, I completed a lot of maintenance and many repairs. The car has recently been detailed and looks great inside and out.

It just completed a round trip to San Francisco without any problems.   It is quite unique as it was brought into the US aftermarket and is equipped with some Euro spec equipment,etc ie: headlights, headlight wipers, onboard air compressor and rear air shocks, flat hood.  It originally had the d24 diesel engine and then someone swapped it with the d24t turbo version.  I don't know who did the swap and I know some say it can't/shouldn't be done cause of spacing issues, but this one fits fine and runs well.  Since I've had it, I've  added a few more extras like an intercooler and electronic turbo boost controller.   Some other aftermarket parts include sport/lowered suspension and IPD front and rear anti-sway bars.  The car has 153,XXX miles.  I'm unsure of how many miles the engine has.  Some of the major things I've done are: Volvo re-manufactured injection pump which now has approx 20,xxx miles on it and timing belt at the same time. Brand new battery.  The car has been my daily driver but is definitely a big project cause of many things that need to be done.  Some of these things include but are not limited to: lower ball joints, some water damage which caused some small rust holes in the floor boards, headlight mods/adjustment, front interior carpet is gone, leaky window seals, will need tires soon, hole from rust at left rear, right front door handle just broke or came disengaged, left front fender rust spot, etc.  Let's talk and I can fill you in.

I bought it for my daughter, but she doesn't want it now, so I must sell it.  I replaced the engine with a low mileage 3400 GM engine, and it runs like a champ, very strong.  Originally these vehicles only came with the 3100 engine, so this is definitely an upgrade.  The only issues remaining is there is an exhaust leak at the flex pipe, cause by a bad front motor mount that needs to be replaced.  After changing the manifold, and replacing gaskets I realized the reason the exhaust is leaking was due to the broken motor mount.  Anyway, I don't plan on doing any further work to remedy these issues so as to keep the price reasonably low.  I've already turned down offers of $800, which I am way past into this car, so if that's what you're thinking, please don't ask.  I'm into the car way more than $800 already just on the engine ($450.00), and body, not to mention my labor which would take the price up considerably.  Anyway, hit me up if you think you might want to check this car out.

One being that it has a rough idle when stopped in gear, the IAC valve controls the idle. When switched to neutral while stopped the idle comes up and the vibration goes away. But it's about $200 for a new valve, it doesn't bother me enough to pay 200 so I haven't replaced it. Anyways, I'm moving to Alaska and can't take it with me so I figured I'd sell it.

Jack performed all the sheet metal work, paint work done to the car, the top was chopped four inches, the fenders, hood cut back six inches to make it more proportion. Then the head lights, tail lights, turn signals were frenched in, bumpers modified, hood pan caked, electric side mirrors, electric windows, hidden door hinges, electric doors, and trunk. The body was frame off, painted Ferrari red as was the suspension, interior was painted lexus charcoal gray, with gray leather and gray tweed, convertible top is Mercedes black. The inside of the car has vintage air, hand made rolled dash, cd stereo with amplifier in trunk, glide bucket seats, console, tilt stainless column, wool rugs. Suspension is original boxed in with mustang II power rack, rear is ford 9 inch with four bar and coil overs, stock gas tank, engine 350 Chevrolet, 350 turbo transmission, 4 wheel disc brakes, extra power cable hook up by right rear tire in case extra battery needed , main battery hidden in trunk. As you can tell in 1988,1989 there was no expense spared on this build, this merc has 33,000 miles on it, original paint, no cracks, chips, never washed with cold water, only luke warm water and has no clear coat. In 1989 at the Oakland roadster show the merc won the modified convertible class, June 1989, car cover, centerfold in Street Rodder, plus the car went on tour thru the US and won many more awards.
